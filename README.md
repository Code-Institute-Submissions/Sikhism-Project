# **Sikhism** - A milestone project

## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, Sikhism-Project.

Earlier this year I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled on a Full Stack Development course, with the hopes of changing my career and to 
become a programmer. Up to this point in my career I have worked in multiple sectors, retail and hospitality but have never managed to get myself anywhere.

The purpose of this project to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learnt, to implement them into a project 
to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations 
and my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did designing and developing it.

## **UX – User Experience Design** ##

A large part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Jason James Garretts’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. 
By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a 
positive one. For the user to have a positive emotional response throughout the project. 

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes, 
- The Strategy Phase
- The Scope Phase
- The Structure Phase
- The Skeleton Phase
- The Surface Phase

## **Strategy Phase** ##

The goal as a creator of my project is to act an introduction to my faith, Sikhism.

**Creator stories**

Creator Goals

- As a creator I want to make sure the project is easy to navigate.
- As a creator, due to the text rich nature of the project, to make sure users never feel lost in the text going through the page.
- As a creator I want the project to invoke a positive emotional response from users, potentially relating to learning something 
new or expanding on current knowledge.
- As a creator I want to make sure all content on the page is relatable, from images, to text and quotes and avoid elements
from feeling random or out of place.
- As a creator I want to avoid users from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content, finding a way to structure content
 so users do not feel put off from the moment they land on a page.
