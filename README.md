## **Introduction** ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, Sikhism-Project.

Earlier this year I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled on a Full Stack Development course, with the hopes of changing my career and to 
become a programmer. Up to this point in my career I have worked in multiple sectors, retail and hospitality but have never managed to get myself anywhere.

The purpose of this project to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learnt, to implement them into a project 
to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations 
and my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did designing and developing it.

## **UX – User Experience Design** ##

A large part of inspiration behind the planning for this project came from Jason James Garretts’s, “The Elements of User-Experience”. 
By keeping the user in mind throughout the design and development of the project, it would be easier to make the user experience a 
positive one. For the user to have a positive emotional response throughout the project. 

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes, 
- The Strategy Phase
- The Scope Phase
- The Structure Phase
- The Skeleton Phase
- The Surface Phase

## **Strategy Phase** ##

The goal as a creator of my project is to act an introduction to my faith, Sikhism.

**Creator stories**

Creator Goals

- As a creator I want to make sure the project is easy to navigate.
- As a creator, due to the text rich nature of the project, to make sure users never feel lost in the text going through the page.
- As a creator I want the project to invoke a positive emotional response from users, potentially relating to learning something 
new or expanding on current knowledge.
- As a creator I want to make sure all content on the page is relatable, from images, to text and quotes and avoid elements
from feeling random or out of place.
- As a creator I want to avoid users from feeling overwhelmed by the amount of content, finding a way to structure content
 so users do not feel put off from the moment they land on a page.

Having established a strategy for what I would like for my users, the most important part was to start thinking from 
the perspective of the user and how a user would feel going through the project.

**User stories**

First time visitor goals,

- As a first-time visitor, I want to easily understand the purpose of the project from the moment I get to the landing page.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to easily be able to navigate, can I get back to the home page quickly, when I reach the 
bottom of a page is there some way to move forward without scrolling back up.
- As a first-time visitor, I want everything I am reading be reinforced or supported in some way, quotes, stories, or images.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to feel as though I am progressing through the page and not feel overwhelmed or lost.
- As a first-time visitor, I want the project to not become to exhausting to look at.
- As a first-time visitor, I want to be able to pick up from where I left off, can the structure of a page be in a way where 
the user can simply just carry on if they took a break ?

Returning visitor goals:

- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to get in contact with the creator or creators in some way, social links or contact page.
- As a returning visitor, I want to be able to cite the information or find out where the original source of the information came from.
- As a returning visitor, I want to know if any new content has been added to the project quickly and efficiently, 
can I sign up to a newsletter or get email updates?
- As a returning visitor, I want to know where any images or videos came from, in case of personal use.

From my user stories I am better able to come up with a conceptual idea of what the project needs in terms of features, which features have more priority overs.

During my initial planning for the project, I was planning to make the project on Sikhs as a people of the faith. 
So, I decided to some research, friends, acquaintances, and work colleagues to understand better which content was more important. 
I was naturally biased being Sikh and everything to me was more important, but I needed to understand the perspective of a user. 

While doing my research I quickly noticed when asking, what would you like to know about Sikhs, a correlation on the feedback being received. 
I was assuming everyone knew about Sikhism without introducing Sikhism.

From the feedback I was also able to gain an understanding of what I should include in my project from the first release. 
Common questions being asked while doing research was,

1.	How did Sikhism originate, who started Sikhism?
2.	Who is a Guru and what is a Gurdwara?
3.	What are the pillars of the faith?
4.	Why is Sikhism important to me?
5.	What is “Langar”?
