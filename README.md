# **Sikhism** - A milestone project

## Introduction ##

Welcome to my first milestone project, Sikhism-Project.

Earlier this year I decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled on a Full Stack Development course, with the hopes of changing my career and to 
become a programmer. Up to this point in my career I have worked in multiple sectors, retail and hospitality but have never managed to get myself anywhere.

The purpose of this project to show my learning and understanding of the modules and languages I have learnt, to implement them into a project 
to showcase my skills in design and development. This project is a functional static-website, built mainly with HTML and CSS.

I will outline the steps I used to build the project and the philosophy used to plan the project, my sources of inspirations 
and my focus on user experience design.

Thank you for viewing my project and I sincerely hope you enjoy the project as much as I did designing and developing it.

## User Experience â€“ UX ##

I used the Jesse James Garrett philosophy to inspire how I would plan my project with the user always in mind and to help me establish which information and features were more important and therefore had higher priority when deploying my project.

## Strategy ##

When initially planning my project, I thought it would be a great idea to make a website based on Sikhs, the people of the faith. As I started doing some research, I quickly noticed a correlation in the questions people had when it came to Sikhism.

**1.	What is Sikhism?**

**2.	How did Sikism originate?**

**3.	What defines are the core pillars of the faith?**

I quickly understood that the project should not be about Sikhs, but more importantly focused on the faith itself. And this helped me to establish the strategy behind the project.

**Who is the website aimed at?**

Somebody who does not know what Sikhism is or some one who has a basic understanding of what Sikhism is but would like to build on their current knowledge and learn more about the faith.

**What is the need for the website?**

When I googled Sikhism, I noticed none of the searches wielded to results I was expecting. I was a surprise to see the BBC website listed and noticed the information on the sites was extremely broad and basic and did not expand of the disciplines of the faith.

## User Expectations: ##

I want the website to able to answer the question that I found coming up most while doing my research but also wanted to provide users with a way to be able to ask questions and get answers. 

Considering the project is going to be information dense, I want to make sure,

*	The user interface is easy to understand and simple in design.
*	Can the content be viewed on different devices, does the content scale properly and is the experience viewing the site on a desktop just as good as on mobile and tablet.
*	Is there a way to reach out, to be able to ask questions, send messages? That is easy and simple to use.

Finally, should the project catch the attention of somebody that would like to collaborate in the future, I would want,

*	A common goal to guide users around the site and make the information easy to take in.
*	To encourage shared values to avoid conflict or confusion but instead to create better opportunities for expansion or innovation.
*	My project to gain the trust and respect or potential collaborators to avoid un-equal contributions.
*	Share my knowledge as well as learn from anyone interested in working together to grow and develop skills.
